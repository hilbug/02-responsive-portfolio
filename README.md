# 02-responsive-portfolio
Using Bootstrap's responsive design, I created a website consisting of three pages:
- About me
- Portfolio
- Contact form

This website should be compatible with a variety devices, evident through the components' resizing on different sized screens. 

I implemented my own CSS to customize background-color, color of text and links, and link pseudoclasses. I also opted to slightly deviate from the provided pictures to better work within the Boostrap grid system. For the Portfolio page, I used a Bootstrap card so that I could add a description along with the image and header banner.

HTML of each page was validated using: https://validator.w3.org/nu/

My website can be accessed here: https://hilbug.github.io/02-responsive-portfolio/

Here is a preview of each page:
